Wordzies is an app to help you expand your vocabulary. I often hear new words and I would like to learn them instead of just forget about them. It would help me keep up in some sophisticated conversations or follow along during political campaigns etc.

On the weekend of Feb 10th-12th, 2012, I entered the idea into Code Academy's Startup Weekend, and the following classmates joined my team:

<ul>
<li>David Levine</li>
<li>Benjamin Block</li>
<li>Kevin Hoffman</li>
<li>Robert Milner</li>
</ul>
